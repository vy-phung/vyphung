    <h1>RNA-sequence re-analysis for the correlation of differential gene expression between fetal and adult brains</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
    I do this project in order to practice and understand deeply how to do genomic data science. <br>
    The purpose of this re-analysis is to examine the correlation of differential gene expression between fetal and adult brains, <br>
    which is evaluated through RNA-sequencing. If it has correlation, then count how many up-regulated and down-regulated genes. <br>
    All of them are done in R, RStudio. <br>

    Moreover, I will use the genomic datasets including not statistically analyzed data, and already statistically analyzed data <br>
    in order to predict and classify some characteristics of samples (gender, age). All of them are done in Python, Google Colab. <br>
