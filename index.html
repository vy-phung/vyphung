    <h2>My profile</h2>
    <p>I am just a person who is curious about the application of data science and statistics to biology especially molecular biology. <br>
        At the moment, my concentration is analyzing the biological data in research for the purpose of applying those discoveries to solve social problems. <br> 
        There are lots of things I need to learn, so it is great that I can connect to anyone who is interested in biology, statistics or data science. <br>
        Moreover, I also like to connect or engage with strangers too because I basically love to laugh, learn and talk about things I haven't known yet.br <br>
